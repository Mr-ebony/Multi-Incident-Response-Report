# Multi-Incident-Response-Report

## Brute-Force Attack Incident Response Report
This project simulates a real-world incident response using a brute-force login attack. I investigated the incident using Splunk logs, documented key Indicators of Compromise (IoCs), and mapped the behaviour to MITRE ATT&CK.
See `Brute_Force_incident_report.md` for the full report. Additionally, to see how a  Brute-force attack was done, please visit my [Splunk-threat-hunting-lab](https://github.com/Mr-ebony/Splunk-threat-hunting-lab.git) project.
