# 🛡️ Incident Response Report

### 🎯 Incident Title: 
Privilege Escalation Simulation

### 1. ℹ Incident Metadata
- **Incident ID:** IR-2025-002  
- **Date & Time Detected:** August 26, 2025, 15:12 UTC  
- **Reported By:** Window Event Viewer – “Suspicious Privilege Escalation”  
- **Severity:** High  
- **Status:** Closed (Simulated Lab Exercise)

---

### 2. 🔎 Executive Summary
This incident report documents a simulated **Privilege Escalation attack** performed in a controlled home lab environment.  
The attacker, using a compromised low-privilege account (`samson1`), attempted to escalate privileges to gain administrative control.  
Logs were collected from **Windows Event Viewer** and ingested into **Splunk** for analysis.  

The purpose of this simulation was to test detection capabilities, analyse relevant security logs, and demonstrate the incident response process.

### 3. 🏹 Attack Description
- **Initial Access:** Low-privilege user account `samson1` was already present on the system.  
- **Action Taken:** Attacker attempted to privilede escalation using:
  1. Simulate UAC Bypass
  2. Use WinPEAS (Automated Escalation Scanner)
 **Goal:** Obtain elevated permissions and access to restricted system resources.

### 6. 📜 Detection & Logging Details

- **Event Viewer Logs:**

  - Security → Event ID 4728 confirmed analyst1 was added to the Administrators group.

  - Event ID 4624 confirmed successful logon with analyst1.

  - Event ID 4672 confirmed assignment of admin privileges.
- **Splunk Queries:**

```spl
index=wineventlog EventCode=4728

```

```spl
index=wineventlog EventCode=4672

```

### 7. 📜 Containment & Remediation
- Removed the user analyst1 from the Administrators group.

- Deleted unused low-privilege test accounts to reduce attack surface.

- Enabled auditing for group membership changes (Event ID 4732).

- Configured a Splunk real-time alert for Event ID 4728 and 4672.
