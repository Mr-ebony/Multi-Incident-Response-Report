# 🛡️ Incident Response Report

### 🎯 Incident Title: 
Privilege Escalation Simulation

### 1. ℹ Incident Metadata
- **Date & Time Detected:** August 26, 2025, 22:48:41 
- **Reported By:** Window Event Viewer – “Suspicious Privilege Escalation”  
- **Severity:** High  
- **Status:** Closed (Simulated Lab Exercise)

---

### 2. 🔎 Executive Summary
This incident report documents a simulated **Privilege Escalation attack** performed in a controlled home lab environment.  
The attacker, using a compromised low-privilege account (`samson1`), attempted to escalate privileges to gain administrative control.  
Logs were collected from **Windows Event Viewer** and ingested into **Splunk** for analysis.  

The purpose of this simulation was to test detection capabilities, analyse relevant security logs, and demonstrate the incident response process.

### 3. 🏹 Attack Description
- **Initial Access:** Low-privilege user account `samson1` was already present on the system.  
- **Action Taken:** Attacker attempted to privilege escalation using:
  1. Simulate UAC Bypass (Please see **Image 5 - 6** within Screenshots/Privilege_escalation)
  2. Use WinPEAS (Automated Escalation Scanner) (Please see **Image 7 - 8** within Screenshots/Privilege_escalation)
 **Goal:** Obtain elevated permissions and access to restricted system resources.

### 5. 📜 Indicators of Compromise (IOCs)

| IOC Type | Value             |
|----------------|--------------------|
| Event ID     | 4728 (User added to group)      |
| Event ID      | 4726 (User account deleted)   |
| Event ID       | 4624 (Successful logon of `samson1`) |
| Event ID   | 4672 (Special privileges assigned)   |
| Usernames      | `samson1` (test accounts) |
| Command Executed   | `net localgroup Administrators analyst1 /add`     |

### 6. 📄 Detection & Logging Details

- **Event Viewer Logs:**

  - Security → Event ID 4728 confirmed samson1 was added to the Administrators group.

  - Event ID 4624 confirmed successful logon with analyst1.

  - Event ID 4672 confirmed assignment of admin privileges.
- **Splunk Queries:**

```spl
index=wineventlog EventCode=4728

```

```spl
index=wineventlog EventCode=4672

```

---

### 7. 🛠 Containment & Remediation
- Removed the user analyst1 from the Administrators group.

- Deleted unused low-privilege test accounts to reduce attack surface.

- Enabled auditing for group membership changes (Event ID 4732).

- Configured a Splunk real-time alert for Event ID 4728 and 4672.

---

### 8. 📈 Lessons Learned & Recommendations
- Privilege escalation is a common post-exploitation technique.

- Monitoring **Windows Security Event Logs** (4728, 4672, 4732) is crucial for detection.

- All privileged account changes should trigger alerts in SIEM.

- Implement the **least privilege principle:** only admins should belong to Administrators.

- Regularly audit group memberships.
