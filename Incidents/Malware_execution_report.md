# ♟ 6. Response Action Taken
1. Window Defender **detected** and quarantined the EICAR file
2. Security logs were **reviewed** in Event Viewer (`Event ID 1116, 1117)
3. Windows viewer was used to inspect the log
4. Defender protection were **re-enabled** after test
5. File and associated logs archived for training and record purpose

---
# 🎡 7. Lessons Learned
- Endpoint protections respond as expected to known threat signatures
- Monitoring rules should be in place to flag malware detection events
- Users should understand the difference between real malware and test simulations

---
# 👑 8. Recommendations 
- Periodically run simulated tests using EICAR to validate endpoint defenses
- Integrate malware detection logs with centralized SIEM
- Maintain documentation of test activities for training and audit purposes
